✨ Feature Breakdown

This Airbnb Clone project replicates core functionalities of the real Airbnb platform, offering users a seamless experience for listing, discovering, and booking properties. Below is a breakdown of the main features:

👥 User Management

Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system supports different roles such as guests and hosts, with secure authentication and role-based access.

🏘️ Property Management

Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details such as title, description, location, pricing, and images, enabling guests to browse and choose suitable accommodations.

📅 Booking System

Guests can view property availability and make bookings for specific dates. The system calculates total cost based on the stay duration and ensures that properties can't be double-booked.

💳 Payment Integration

The platform includes a mock payment system to simulate real-world transactions. Payments are associated with bookings to track status (e.g., paid, pending) and provide confirmation to users.

⭐ Reviews and Ratings

After completing a stay, guests can leave reviews and rate properties. This feature helps maintain trust and transparency by providing feedback for future guests.

🔍 Search and Filtering

Users can search for properties based on location, price range, availability, and other criteria. This improves discoverability and enhances the overall user experience.

🖼️ Image Uploads

Hosts can upload multiple images for each property to give guests a clear visual idea of the space. Images are stored and linked directly to the corresponding listings.



Users can search for properties based on location, price range, availabile

🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code. They help catch issues early, reduce manual work, and ensure that new changes can be safely integrated into the project.

🔄 Why CI/CD Is Important:

Faster Development Cycles: Automates testing and deployment so developers can focus on writing code.

Improved Code Quality: Automatically runs test suites to catch bugs before deployment.

Reliable Deployments: Ensures consistent and repeatable deployments across environments.

Team Collaboration: Encourages frequent integration of code, reducing merge conflicts and integration issues.

🧰 Tools We Use:

GitHub Actions: For automating workflows such as testing, building Docker images, and deploying the app.

Docker: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry: For storing and distributing built images.

(Optional) AWS/GCP/Heroku: For deploying and hosting the application in the cloud.

Example CI/CD Flow:

Developer pushes code to GitHub.

GitHub Actions runs tests and builds a Docker image.

If successful, the image is pushed to Docker Hub or a registry.

The app is deployed to the staging or production server.

🔐 API Security

Ensuring the security of our backend APIs is critical to protect user data, prevent abuse, and maintain trust across the platform. Below are the key security measures implemented in this project, along with their importance in different areas of the system.

🔑 Authentication

We implement secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify the identity of users accessing the platform.
Why it's important: This protects access to personal accounts and ensures that only legitimate users can perform actions such as bookings or listing properties.

🔒 Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to ensure users only have permission to access or modify resources relevant to their role (e.g., guests can’t edit others’ listings).
Why it's important: This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and actions, such as modifying another user's property or viewing admin-level data.

🚫 Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is applied to API endpoints to prevent abuse, such as brute-force login attempts or spammy requests.
Why it's important: This protects the platform from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures fair usage of resources.

🛡️ Data Validation & Sanitization

All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Why it's important: This ensures system integrity by preventing malicious data from compromising the application or database.

🔐 HTTPS Encryption

All API traffic is secured using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit between clients and the server.
Why it's important: This protects sensitive information (like login credentials and payment details) from being intercepted over the network.

💳 Payment Security

Although we use a mock payment system, in a production environment we would integrate a secure third-party payment processor (e.g., Stripe) that complies with PCI-DSS standards.
Why it's important: Protects users’ financial data and ensures safe transactions.
